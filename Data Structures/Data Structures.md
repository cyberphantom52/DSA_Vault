Data structures are fundamental concepts in computer science that allow us to organize and store data efficiently. They provide a way to manage and manipulate data in a way that facilitates various operations, such as insertion, deletion, searching, and sorting. Choosing the right data structure is crucial as it directly impacts the performance and efficiency of algorithms that operate on the data.

# Some common data structures

- [[Array]]: A a collection of elements of the same data type. Arrays offer $O(1)$ access to elements.

- [[Linked List]]: A linear data structure consisting of nodes where each node contains a reference to the next node in the sequence. It allows dynamic memory allocation and more efficient insertion and deletion compared to arrays.

- [[Stack]]: A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It is often used for managing function calls, backtracking, and expression evaluation.

- [[Queue]]: A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It is useful for managing processes, scheduling, and handling requests.

- [[Tree]]: Trees are hierarchical data structures consisting of nodes connected by edges. 

- [[Graph]]: Graphs are collections of nodes (vertices) connected by edges (links). They are used for modeling complex relationships and networks.  

- [[Hash Map|Hash Table]]: A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs and provides fast access and insertion using a hash function to map keys to specific locations (buckets) in the table.

- [[Heap]]: Heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the Heap property. A Heap is often used to implement priority queues, which are data structures that allow efficient retrieval of the minimum or maximum element.

- [[String]]: String is an array data structure of bytes (or words) that stores a sequence of elements, typically characters, using some character encoding

# Additional Data Structures

- [[Fenwick Tree]]: A data structure that supports sum range queries as well as setting values in a static array and getting the value of the prefix sum upto some index efficiently.
