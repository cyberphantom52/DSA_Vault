A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has either 0,1 or 2 children.

## Types of Binary Tree

- **Full Binary Tree**: For a binary tree of height 'h', a Full Binary Tree has 2^h+1 - 1 nodes i.e. it is a binary tree with max possible nodes present.
- **Complete Binary Tree**:  In a complete binary tree, all the levels of a tree are filled entirely except the last level. In the last level, nodes might or might not be filled fully. Also, letâ€™s note that all the nodes should be filled from the left. When the tree is complete then the last level might or might not be full.
- **Almost Complete Binary Tree**: An almost complete binary tree is a special kind of binary tree where insertion takes place level by level and from left to right order at each level and the last level is not filled fully always. It also contains 2^L nodes at each level except the last level. In an almost complete binary tree the last level is not full for sure.
