Dynamic Programming is a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler sub-problems, solving each of those sub-problems just once, and storing their solutions using a memory-based data structure ([[Array]], [[Hash Map]], etc.). So the next time the same sub-problem occurs, instead of recomputing its solution, one simply looks up the previously computed solution, thereby saving computation time.
