## Basic Searching/Traversal Algorithms

All data structures are meant to hold information. Some structures need specials ways to access this information efficiently that are more involved than simply accessing an [[array]] index or [[Hash Map]] key. Data-structures that hold collections of data such as Trees and Graphs use a few basic algorithms to access the information within.

-   [[Depth-First Search]]
-   [[Breadth-First Search]]
-   [[Binary Search]]
